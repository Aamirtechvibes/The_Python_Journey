## 🧪 List & Tuple Practice

This script includes some fun experiments I did while learning about Python lists and tuples.

## 🧠 What it does:

- Checks if a list is a **palindrome**
- Counts specific values in a **tuple**
- Sorts a list of **grades**
- Uses `.copy()`, `.reverse()`, `.count()`, `.sort()` – all in one practice file

## 💡 Why I made this

II wanted to try combining multiple list and tuple operations in a single script and understand how they work together.  
This helped me understand logic flow and real-world use-cases like grade analysis.

## 🚀 Next goal:
Turn the palindrome check into a function and accept dynamic input from users!
